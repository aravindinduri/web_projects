    <i>Born on 22 July 1925, Daasarathi Krishnamacharyulu, also known as Daasarathi, was a poet, writer, thinker, and freedom fighter. He was a well-read scholar of the Puranas. He postponed his higher education to join a movement to fight against the autocratic rule of the Nizam of Hyderabad. His revolutionary poems were influenced by the communist ideology of Karl Marx. Some of his famous poems are ‘Maatrubhoomi’, ‘Desabhakti’, ‘Prajaporatam’, ‘Dharmachakram’, ‘Vasanthakumari’, ‘Silpi’, etc. He went to jail for participating in Satyagraha, and recently, his jail cell was renamed ‘Daasarathi cell’. He was awarded the State Academy Award in 1967. </i>
    
        <h3>Imprisoned and Struggle:</h3>
        <p>Dasarathi was arrested in 1947 and was sent to Warangal central jail, along with many other leaders who went on to prominence in independent India. Dasarathi was later moved to Nizamabad central jail. While in jail he wrote poetry. After his release he left Telangana for Vijayawada and wrote poetry against the Nizam in Telugu Desam, a daily paper devoted to news and articles related to Telangana and the Nizam's rule.

            In 1948, the Indian Union took over the Hyderabad State in a police action and put an end to the autocratic Nizam rule and to the violence unleashed by the Razakars and Mazlis Ittehadul Muslimeen Party. Later, in 1956 the Telangana part of the Hyderabad state was united with the state of Andhra and eventually formed the state of Andhra Pradesh, which was till June 2, 2014.
            
            After democratic rule was established in Hyderabad, Dasarathi served in the government of Andhra Pradesh for some time. Later, he worked for All India Radio Hyderabad and Madras (Chennai) as a prompter and retired in 1971. He served as the Government Poet from 1971 through 1984. He also rendered services as an emeritus producer for All India Radio and Doordarshan (Television).
